## 🏛️ Architectural Philosophy

This website was designed with a **"Separation of Content from Presentation"** philosophy. Instead of hard-coding content directly into the UI components, it's managed entirely through simple **Markdown** and **YAML** files. This approach provides several key advantages:
- **Ease of Updates:** Projects, articles, and bio information can be added or modified quickly without any coding knowledge.
- **Flexibility:** The entire website's design can be overhauled in the future without affecting the content.
- **Performance:** This architecture allows for pre-building pages into static assets (Static Site Generation), ensuring blazing-fast load times.
