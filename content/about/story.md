## My Story

I'm an AI researcher and electrical engineer with a deep passion for solving real-world problems using machine learning. My work spans across computer vision, time-series forecasting, and self-supervised learning. I specialize in designing scalable, reproducible pipelines that are not just functionalâ€”but robust and insightful.

From predicting wind energy output to detecting waste using deep learning, I've led and contributed to projects that demand both engineering precision and scientific thinking.

## My Approach

I believe in building AI systems that are not just technically sound, but also understandable and maintainable. My workflow integrates careful experimentation, clear documentation, and user-centered design principles. I aim to bridge academic insight and industrial utility.

## Why Work With Me

- **Research-Minded, Product-Oriented**: I fuse academic rigor with practical engineering.
- **Reproducibility Champion**: I build modular, pipeline-driven codebases that are easy to extend.
- **Computer Vision Specialist**: From augmentation to detection, I understand images deeply.
- **Team-Oriented**: I enjoy mentoring, collaborating, and building great things with others.
