## My Story

I'm an Electrical engineer with a focus on digital signal processing and a deep passion for solving real-world problems using Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision. I like to design a scalable, reproducible pipelines that are not just functionalâ€”but robust and insightful to automate many tasks!

currently i'm working on researchs related to self-supervised learning, and exploring and investigating in the potential of recent AI trends and aiming to utilize last tech to the best i can to make a big success!

## My Approach

I believe in building AI systems that are not just technically sound, but also understandable and maintainable. My workflow integrates careful experimentation, clear documentation, and user-centered design principles. I aim to bridge academic insight and industrial utility.
