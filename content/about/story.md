## My Journey: From Engineering Principles to Intelligent Systems

My career is a story about building things that workâ€”and then making them intelligent. I began with a foundation in Electrical Engineering at KFUPM, where I developed a deep appreciation for the principles that govern complex systems. This background taught me to think methodically, test rigorously, and value solutions that are not just clever, but also robust and reliable.

As I moved into my Master's studies, my focus shifted to a new, exciting frontier: applying that same engineering rigor to the world of Artificial Intelligence. I discovered a passion for the complete lifecycle of data-driven products, from the initial spark of an idea to the final deployed application.

My goal is to do more than just build models; it is to engineer complete, end-to-end systems that deliver tangible value and solve meaningful problems
