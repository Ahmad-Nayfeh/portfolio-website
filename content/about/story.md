## My Journey: From Engineering Principles to Intelligent Systems

My career is a story about building things that work—and then making them intelligent. I began with a foundation in Electrical Engineering at KFUPM, where I developed a deep appreciation for the principles that govern complex systems. This background taught me to think methodically, test rigorously, and value solutions that are not just clever, but also robust and reliable.

As I moved into my Master's studies, my focus shifted to a new, exciting frontier: applying that same engineering rigor to the world of Artificial Intelligence. I discovered a passion for the complete lifecycle of data-driven products, from the initial spark of an idea to the final deployed application.

> My goal is to do more than just build models; it is to engineer complete, end-to-end systems that deliver tangible value and solve meaningful problems.

## My Guiding Principles

These principles are the bedrock of my work and are present in every project I undertake:

* **Evidence is Everything:** I operate on a strict "no assumptions" policy. Every skill I claim and every technical decision I make is backed by demonstrable evidence and rigorous testing from my project work.
* **Robustness by Design:** A model that only works on clean, lab-condition data is an incomplete solution. I stress-test my systems—whether by introducing noise to a signal or handling real-world data variability—to ensure they are resilient and reliable.
* **Full-Stack Ownership:** I believe in owning the entire process. A project isn't complete until the data pipeline is efficient, the model is effective, and the solution is deployed in an accessible, interactive application.
