# Wind Power Forecasting

## Overview

This project tackles the challenge of short-term wind power prediction using a hybrid approach that combines deep learning and ensemble methods. The pipeline implements two forecasting strategies: (1) **Direct LSTM** that predicts power output from raw inputs, and (2) **Indirect LSTMâ†’Random Forest**, where LSTM predicts meteorological features used by a Random Forest to estimate power. The solution includes robust data preprocessing, model training, visual analytics, and performance benchmarking.

## Motivation

Accurate wind power forecasting is critical for grid stability and energy planning. This project simulates a real-world scenario of turbine-level forecasting using publicly available data and explores whether hybrid learning models can improve accuracy, robustness, or interpretability over pure deep learning models.

## Technical Approach

- **Dataset**: Hourly wind turbine data (`Active Power`, `Wind Speed`, `Wind Direction`, `Power Curve`)
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Resampling to hourly intervals
  - Handling missing values with forward/backward filling
  - Scaling with `MinMaxScaler`
- **Two Forecasting Pipelines**:
  - **Direct**: LSTM â†’ Power
  - **Indirect**: LSTM â†’ Features â†’ Random Forest â†’ Power
- **Modeling**:
  - LSTM: 2-layer Keras Sequential model with early stopping & learning curves
  - RF: 50-tree scikit-learn model using predicted LSTM features
- **Evaluation Metrics**: MAE, RMSE, RÂ², IA, SDE, MAPE
- **Visualization**:
  - Actual vs. Predicted curves
  - Feature distributions and ACF/PACF
  - Correlation heatmaps and learning curves

## Key Features / Contributions

- End-to-end pipeline for sequential time series forecasting
- Fully modular: config-driven experimentation across approaches
- Resilient evaluation framework with inverse scaling and data windowing
- Automated saving of models, plots, metrics for both pipelines
- Rich set of reusable utilities for scaling, splitting, and sequence generation

## Results & Findings

| Approach | MAE | RMSE | RÂ² | IA | SDE | MAPE |
|----------|-----|------|-----|-----|------|------|
| **Direct LSTM** | 231.81 | 375.24 | 0.9261 | 0.9805 | 374.72 | 288.02 |
| **Indirect (LSTM â†’ RF)** | 429.12 | 720.31 | 0.7278 | 0.9170 | 711.10 | 1017.82 |

- **Direct LSTM** significantly outperforms the hybrid pipeline in all metrics, especially error-based ones (RMSE, MAPE)
- The hybrid method's reduced performance suggests feature drift between predicted features and ground truth inputs for RF

## Reflection

This project deepened my understanding of temporal forecasting, especially the effects of model architecture on downstream performance. It also offered hands-on practice with pipeline design, modularization, and interpretable evaluation in time-series modeling. Potential next steps include testing exogenous variables, adding weather forecast integration, or transitioning to probabilistic models.
